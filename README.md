# Fact or Fiction

Simple discord bot that plays a simple game:

1. Provides a random prompt, e.g. "The Name of Kanye West's next album"
2. Provides two random cards (sourced from [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/))
3. Chat votes on which one they like more

This game is a fun alternative to arguing over how to roll a die.
