# Fact or Fiction

Simple discord bot that plays a simple game:

1. Provides a random prompt, e.g. "The Name of Kanye West's next album"
2. Provides two random cards (sourced from [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/))
3. Chat votes on which one they like more with reactions 1️⃣ or 2️⃣

This game is a fun, casual alternative to arguing over how to roll a die. Perfect for cube!

### TODO

- Allow prompts to be filtering by card type, like "Only spells" or "Only creatures"
